To do:

- add pagination if I have time, or remove the logic for it that I put in cards
- finish filters - DONE!
- add product page IN PROGRESS
- add cartRemoveItem and cartUpdateItem
- add redirect to 404 when category or subcat or product doesn't exist, maybe only match route if the route items check out against the item data list?
